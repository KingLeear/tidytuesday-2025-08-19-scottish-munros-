Tableau visualizations of Scottish Munros: height, prominence, and yearly status (TidyTuesday 2025 W33)
TidyTuesday 2025-08-19: Scottish Munros (Tableau Visualization)

This repository contains my Tableau visualizations for the TidyTuesday dataset of 2025-08-19, focusing on Scottish Munros — mountains in Scotland over 3,000 feet.

Instead of using R or Python, I explored this dataset through interactive Tableau dashboards, highlighting patterns in height, prominence, and changes in mountain classification status.

Results

Based on my Tableau exploration of the Scottish Munros dataset:
	1.	How many peaks currently listed as Munros have always been included on the list?
→ 467
	2.	Which year saw the largest number of changes to the classification?
→ 1921
	3.	Which Munro is the most remote?
→ Ben Hope (DoBIH number: 1123, Distance with origin: 981,920)

Disclaimer

This is my first time practicing with Tableau, so I cannot guarantee that all the answers are perfectly correct. However, I tried multiple calculation methods and cross-checks within Tableau to validate the results as much as possible.
